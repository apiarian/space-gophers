# Space Gophers macOS Screen Saver

A macOS screensaver inspired GopherCon 2017.

Gopher images from [Ashely McNamara's fantastic collection](https://github.com/ashleymcnamara/gophers).


## Development Notes

Open the `space-gophers` project in Xcode. Make changes. Press `ctrl-b` to rebuild the project. Right click on the `space-gophers.savers` file in the Products group, and click `Show in Finder`. Double-click to install or reinstall the screensaver. **Quit** and reopen `System Preferences.app` to see the changes in the preview and sample of the screen saver.

You will probably need to link your Xcode to a developer account and adjust the signing team in the Signing section of the Xcode project settings. If somebody has a better idea of how to deal with these signing things on open-source Xcode projects, please open an issue or pull request. Or at least some clarification on this point?
